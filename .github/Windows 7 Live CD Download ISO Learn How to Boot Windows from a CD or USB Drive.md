# How to Create a Windows 7 Live CD with ISO File
 
A Windows 7 live CD is a bootable disc that contains a preinstalled environment of Windows 7. It allows you to run Windows 7 without installing it on your hard drive. You can use it to troubleshoot your computer, recover your data, or test new software. In this article, we will show you how to create a Windows 7 live CD with an ISO file.
 
An ISO file is an image file that contains all the data of a CD or DVD. You can download an ISO file of Windows 7 from Microsoft Store or other sources. However, you cannot simply copy the ISO file to a CD or USB drive and expect it to boot. You need to use a special tool that can extract the files from the ISO file and make the disc or drive bootable.
