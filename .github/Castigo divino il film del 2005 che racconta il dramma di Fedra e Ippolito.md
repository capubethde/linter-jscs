Castigo divino is a 2005 short film directed by Jaime Ruiz IbÃ¡Ã±ez, based on the ancient Greek myth of Phaedra and Hippolytus. The film is set in modern-day Mexico, where Phaedra (Susana Salazar) is the young and beautiful second wife of Theseus (Fernando Becerril), a wealthy businessman. She falls in love with her stepson Hippolytus (Guillermo IvÃ¡n), a handsome and rebellious student who rejects her advances. In despair, she tries to kill herself and accuses Hippolytus of raping her. When Theseus returns home from work, he faces a big dilemma: who is telling the truth, his wife or his son?

The film explores themes of lust, guilt, betrayal, and justice, as well as the contrast between the ancient and the modern world. The director uses a minimalist style, with few dialogues and long shots, to create a tense and dramatic atmosphere. The film also features an original score by David MorÃ¡n, and a cinematography by Alejandro CantÃº that captures the urban and domestic settings of the story.
 
Castigo divino was well received by critics and audiences alike, winning several awards at national and international film festivals. The film was praised for its acting performances, especially by Salazar and IvÃ¡n, who portrayed the complex emotions of their characters with subtlety and intensity.

The film also delves into the different versions of the myth, showing how Phaedra's motives and Hippolytus' fate vary depending on the source. In some accounts, Phaedra is a wicked and lustful woman who schemes to seduce her stepson and then falsely accuses him of rape when he spurns her. In others, she is a noble and virtuous queen who suffers from an unwanted passion that is inflicted on her by the goddess Aphrodite as a punishment for Hippolytus' disdain of love. Similarly, Hippolytus is sometimes portrayed as a chaste and devout follower of Artemis, who rejects Phaedra out of loyalty to his father and his goddess. In other versions, he is a proud and arrogant youth who insults Aphrodite and scorns Phaedra's feelings.
 
The film also explores the role of the gods in the tragedy, especially Aphrodite and Artemis, who are both worshipped by Hippolytus but have opposite views on love and sexuality. Aphrodite is the one who instigates the whole plot, either by making Phaedra fall in love with Hippolytus or by inspiring her nurse to reveal her secret to him. She also influences Theseus to curse his son with one of his wishes from Poseidon, which leads to Hippolytus' death by a sea monster. Artemis, on the other hand, tries to protect Hippolytus from harm, but she is powerless against the will of Aphrodite and Poseidon. She only manages to reveal the truth to Theseus after Hippolytus' death and to promise him vengeance on Aphrodite.
 
The film also examines the themes of human nature and morality, as well as the consequences of passion and deception. The characters are faced with dilemmas that test their values and their relationships. Phaedra has to choose between her love for Hippolytus and her duty to Theseus. Hippolytus has to decide whether to honor his father or his goddess. Theseus has to judge between his wife and his son. The film shows how their choices affect not only themselves but also those around them, causing pain, guilt, anger, and regret. The film also questions whether the characters are responsible for their actions or whether they are merely victims of fate and divine intervention.
