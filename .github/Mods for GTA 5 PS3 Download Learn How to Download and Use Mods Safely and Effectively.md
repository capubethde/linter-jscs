# How to Download Mods for GTA 5 on PS3
 
Grand Theft Auto V is one of the most popular and moddable games of all time. However, if you own a PS3 version of the game, you might be wondering how to download and install mods for GTA 5 on your console. In this article, we will show you the steps you need to follow to enjoy some of the best mods that the GTA V community has created.
 
Before we begin, you should know that modding GTA 5 on PS3 is not officially supported by Rockstar Games and it may violate their terms of service. You also run the risk of crashing your game, corrupting your save files, or getting banned from GTA Online if you try to access it with mods enabled. Therefore, you should always make a backup of your original unmodded GTA 5 folder and use mods at your own risk.
