Adobe Type Manager (ATM) is a software program that allows you to manage and use PostScript fonts on your computer. It was originally designed for Windows 3.1 and later versions, but it is not compatible with Windows 7 64-bit. However, there is a way to install and run ATM on Windows 7 64-bit using a virtual machine.
 
A virtual machine is a software that emulates a different operating system within your current one. You can use a virtual machine to run Windows XP or Windows 98 on your Windows 7 64-bit computer, and then install ATM on the virtual machine. This way, you can use ATM to manage and print your PostScript fonts without any compatibility issues.

Here are the steps to install Adobe Type Manager on Windows 7 64-bit using a virtual machine:
 
1. Download and install a virtual machine software such as VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player. You can find them online for free or for a fee.
2. Download and install a Windows XP or Windows 98 ISO file. This is an image file that contains the installation files for the operating system. You can find them online from various sources, but make sure they are legal and virus-free.
3. Create a new virtual machine using the virtual machine software and the ISO file. Follow the instructions on the screen to set up the virtual machine with enough memory, disk space, and network settings.
4. Start the virtual machine and complete the installation of Windows XP or Windows 98. You may need to enter a product key or activate the operating system depending on the source of the ISO file.
5. Download and install Adobe Type Manager from Adobe's website or from a CD-ROM. You may need to register or activate the software depending on the version you have.
6. Restart the virtual machine and launch Adobe Type Manager. You can now use it to manage and print your PostScript fonts as you would on a regular Windows computer.

Note that you may need to adjust some settings on the virtual machine such as screen resolution, sound, and printer to make it work properly with ATM. You may also need to share folders or files between the virtual machine and your host computer if you want to access your fonts or documents from both sides.
 
By following these steps, you can install Adobe Type Manager on Windows 7 64-bit using a virtual machine and enjoy using your PostScript fonts without any hassle.
  
Adobe Type Manager has many benefits for users who work with PostScript fonts. Some of these benefits are:

- It allows you to view and print high-quality fonts on any printer, even if the printer does not support PostScript. ATM rasterizes the fonts on the fly and sends them to the printer as bitmaps[^1^].
- It lets you organize and manage your fonts easily, by creating font sets, groups, and folders. You can also preview and compare fonts before using them[^1^] [^3^].
- It supports OpenType fonts, which are cross-platform and contain advanced typographic features such as ligatures, swashes, and alternate glyphs[^1^].
- It integrates with other Adobe products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, to provide consistent font rendering and editing across applications[^4^].
- It enhances your digital experience by connecting with Adobe Experience Manager, a cloud-based solution that helps you create and deliver personalized content to your customers across different channels and devices[^2^].

With Adobe Type Manager, you can enjoy working with PostScript fonts on your Windows 7 64-bit computer without compromising on quality or performance.
