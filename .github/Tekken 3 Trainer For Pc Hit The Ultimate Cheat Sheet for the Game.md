# How to Use Tekken 3 Trainer for PC to Unlock All Characters and Modes
 
Tekken 3 is one of the most popular fighting games of all time, released in 1997 for arcade and PlayStation. The game features 23 different characters, each with their own unique moves and skills, as well as various game modes such as Arcade, Versus, Team Battle, Survival, Time Attack, Practice, and Tekken Force. However, not all of these characters and modes are available from the start. You have to complete certain challenges or play a certain number of times to unlock them.
 
But what if you want to access everything right away, without having to spend hours or days playing the game? Well, there is a solution for that: using a Tekken 3 trainer for PC. A trainer is a program that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate cheats such as infinite health, infinite EX bar, one-hit kills, super speed, slow motion, and more. You can also use a trainer to unlock all the characters and modes in Tekken 3, without having to meet the normal requirements.
