The book was first published in 1962, and has been translated into several languages. It is considered a classic of Indonesian literature and a source of inspiration for many women activists. The book also provides a glimpse into the history and culture of Indonesia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was under Dutch colonial rule.
 
Panggil Aku Kartini Saja is a must-read for anyone who is interested in learning more about Kartini, one of the most influential figures in Indonesian history. The book showcases her courage, intelligence, and passion for social justice. It also reveals her personal struggles, joys, and sorrows as a woman who dared to dream beyond the confines of her society.

The book is divided into four parts, each corresponding to a different period of Kartini's life. The first part covers her childhood and adolescence, when she was educated at home and exposed to various books and magazines that sparked her interest in the outside world. The second part covers her engagement and marriage to a Javanese regent, who allowed her to continue her correspondence with her friends and mentors in Europe. The third part covers her efforts to establish a school for girls in her husband's territory, where she taught them basic skills and knowledge. The fourth part covers her death at the age of 25, shortly after giving birth to her first child.
 
The book is not only a biography of Kartini, but also a commentary on the social and political issues of her time. Kartini was critical of the feudal system that oppressed the native population, the colonial system that exploited the natural resources and labor of Indonesia, and the patriarchal system that limited the rights and opportunities of women. She advocated for reforms and changes that would improve the lives of her people, especially women and children. She also expressed her admiration for the cultures and civilizations of Europe, America, and Asia, and hoped for a peaceful and harmonious coexistence among them.
