If you are looking for a high-performance SDR software for Windows that can handle multiple devices and offer advanced DSP features, you might want to check out Studio 1.
  
In this article, we will show you how to install and use Studio 1 with an RTL-SDR device. RTL-SDR is a cheap USB dongle that can receive radio signals from 24 MHz to 1766 MHz. RTL-SDR can be used for various applications, such as scanning, monitoring, decoding and more.
 
## Installing Studio 1
 
To install Studio 1, you need to download the installer from the SDRplay website. You also need to download the ExtIO\_RTL2832.dll file from the RTL-SDR website. This file is needed to connect Studio 1 with the RTL-SDR device.
 
After downloading the files, run the Studio 1 installer and follow the instructions. When prompted, choose the installation folder for Studio 1. You can also choose to create a desktop shortcut and a start menu entry for Studio 1.
 
After the installation is complete, copy the ExtIO\_RTL2832.dll file to the same folder where you installed Studio 1. This will allow Studio 1 to recognize the RTL-SDR device.
 
## Using Studio 1
 
To use Studio 1, plug in your RTL-SDR device to a USB port on your computer. Then launch Studio 1 from the desktop shortcut or the start menu. You should see a window like this:

The main window of Studio 1 consists of several panels and menus. The top panel shows the frequency spectrum and waterfall of the received signal. The bottom panel shows the audio spectrum and level of the demodulated signal. The left panel shows the control panel for various settings and functions. The right panel shows the status and information of the SDR device and the software.
 
To select an SDR device, click on the SDR button on the left panel. A window will pop up with a list of available devices. Choose ExtIO\_RTL2832.dll from the list and click OK. You should see a green LED on the right panel indicating that the device is connected.

To tune to a frequency, you can use several methods. You can type in the frequency in the box on the left panel and press Enter. You can use the mouse wheel to scroll up or down on the frequency spectrum or waterfall. You can also click and drag on the frequency spectrum or waterfall to move around. You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to fine tune the frequency.
 
To change the modulation mode, you can use the buttons on the left panel or press F1-F8 on your keyboard. The available modes are AM, FMN (narrow FM), FMW (wide FM), LSB (lower sideband), USB (upper sideband), CW (continuous wave), DRM (digital radio mondiale) and DAB+ (digital audio broadcasting). Each mode has its own settings and options that you can adjust on the left panel.
