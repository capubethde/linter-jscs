# East West Quantum Leap Ministry Of Rock: A Virtual Instrument for Rock Music Production
 
East West Quantum Leap Ministry Of Rock is a sound library that features a collection of hard-hitting drums, bass and guitars for creating realistic rock music tracks. It was created by award-winning sound producers Doug Rogers and Nick Phoenix, and recorded at the legendary EASTWEST Studios using vintage and modern gear. The library includes performances from some of the industry's top rock musicians, such as Shane Gibson (guitarist with Korn), Greg Suran (guitarist with the B-52s, Goo Goo Dolls), Doug Rappaport (guitarist with Edgar Winter), and Tal Bergman (drummer with Billy Idol, LL Cool J, Rod Stewart).[^1^]
 
The library is powered by the PLAY engine, which allows users to customize the sound and performance of each instrument, as well as access dozens of MIDI tools and mixer effects. The library also features repetition samples for everything, extreme dynamics, and three mic positions for drums. Users can create their own custom kits by selecting any drum from any kit, and choose from six additional snare drums. The guitars were sampled twice for each note, with one panned hard left and the other hard right, to create a genuine double-tracked sound.[^1^]
