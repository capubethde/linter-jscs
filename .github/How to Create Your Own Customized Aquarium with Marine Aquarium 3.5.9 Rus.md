A study by researchers from the University of Plymouth, the University of Exeter and the National Marine Aquarium found that viewing aquarium displays led to noticeable reductions in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as improved mood [^2^].
- Improving sleep quality: Aquariums can also help people fall asleep faster and sleep better, as they provide a soothing and natural sound that can mask unwanted noises. A study by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania found that the presence of an aquarium reduced the participants' anxiety levels by 12% before undergoing dental surgery [^4^].
- Enhancing cognitive function: Aquariums can also stimulate people's curiosity and interest in learning more about marine life and the environment. A study by researchers from the University of Exeter found that higher numbers of fish in aquariums helped to hold people's attention for longer and improve their memory [^2^]. The marine aquarium trade has also benefited science by providing easy access to marine species for research [^5^].
- Decreasing hyperactivity in children: Aquariums can also have a positive impact on children's behaviour and development, especially those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The presence of an aquarium can reduce hyperactivity in children as well as improving their sleeping patterns and overall curiosity and appreciation for the natural world .
